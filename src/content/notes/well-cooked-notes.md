I like to have a tagging system for notes, so I can easily find them, especially because I tend to have multiple notes on a single topic as they are new chapters of a book that is written in different moments, with different knowledge and influences.


One that I particularly like is adding a tag for saying how mature this though is.
I use meat cook-time, raw, rare medium, medium, well-cooked, ecc.


This gives me a context of how I feel this is something to work on, or something I alewady gathered informations or experience about it
Why meat? is funny and maps very well with emojis `🥩 🥓 🍖 🍔 `
