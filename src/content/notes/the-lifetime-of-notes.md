Notes are life a snapshot of a thought in a specific point in time, what we knew until this point made us write something instead of something else.

We might have changed ideas of the topic and we will in the future by reading a new (or old) book or having a conversation with someone owning a different point of view.

I find this interesting and I think It's worth updating notes as we go along, without removing that has been written before.

Writing is a though process for me, I like how it helps me take something very amorphous and turn it into something very concrete, the real difference is that I can start watching a though in a more objective way.

I tend to write notes in a very random moments and stop thinking about them for a while.

When my mind goes back to something I wrote already, if I wrote about it in the past I tend to create a new note and link to the old one, not sure why I don't just update the old note, maybe becuause I like the idea if keeping the metadata of the notes true, like the date of creation, the tags, etc.
