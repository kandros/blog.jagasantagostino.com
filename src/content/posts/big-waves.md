Here in sardinia theres a lot of wind, like A LOT of wind. didnt expect that.
i avoided going to the beach because of the wind in the past cause i felt like i was only enjoying the calm sea.

the one day is was to hot that i went anyway.
I staid there playing with the strong waves, running into them, punching them, trying to swim following the waves or against them.

I had a lot of fun, a different feeling of freedom compared with the cal of floating and thinking.

I learned something new I enjoy, in a different fashion thad I expected not to like.

Experiementing really is the way to happiness, and as things change we change, and we should not be too atached to versions of ourselves that got shaped by past events and experiences

a question for you reading, and me..
