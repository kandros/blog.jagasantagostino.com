Since I'm moved by the sea, I have a different approach to swimming and enjoy the sea in general.

I don't have to maximise the time spent in at the beach to justify the expenses of a hotel, a place etc.

I can go to the beach and just tip the toes while listening to a podcast or reading a book and come back home after 20 minutes.

This greatly changed the way to prepare myself for going to the beach.

I prefer to go foot, so carrying a chair or other things is not a great idea, the less I have to carry the more I'm likely to go and swim in random moments when I feel like it.

I often went alone to the beach but didn't swim cause I was afraid to leave the phone and my belonging alone
i went there without anithing but isa bummer caus i enjoy staing there alone and taking notes or read on the phone etc



then one day i remembered that I've taken an impermeable phone case for a 2 day kayaking trip in i've bene gifted for my 33th birthday
and I've found that not only it can carry a bit iphone15 pro max but my glasses and my airpods (without case)  and keys

this made me realize that I can just leave my shoe in the bitch (or use scarpe da scoglio, che ho scopero essere comodissime per qeueste escursioni)
and just swim with my phone and my belonging

i went swimming alone way more often since this discovery.
and everytie I still feel how amazing is being alone in the sea carried by the waves, sometimes to better feel my thoughts some other times to run away from them.
